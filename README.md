# Note-Taker-App

## Description

My motivation is to create a Note Taker App that enables users to write, save, and delete notes. This is especially helpful for small business owners and students, as it'll help with organizing thoughts and keeping track of endless tasks.

## Installation

As the developer, I downloaded and used Node.js's Express app to set up routes to make the app functional, along with Node.js's uuid package to capture unique ids linked with each.

No extra installations are needed for the user, aside from a working computer and internet, since the notes will be added, saved, and deleted through the browser.

## Usage

Please check out the application on Heroku.


## Credits

I had some help from my bootcamp tutor, Sam; otherwise, there were no other contributors. 

## License

This application used Node.js, which is licensed under MIT.

## How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest! Please contact me via email should you have suggestions or feedback to improve my app.
